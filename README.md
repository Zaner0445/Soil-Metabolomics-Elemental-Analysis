# Elemental Ratio Analysis Script for Soil Metabolomics

This repository contains an R script designed for calculating and visualizing elemental ratios (C/N, C/P, C/S, O/C, H/C) in soil samples. The script processes CSV data, calculates ratios, and generates box plots to compare ratios across different soil types.

## Installation
1. Install R and RStudio if you don't have them yet.
2. Install the required R libraries:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))
    ```

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the R script in RStudio.
3. Set your working directory to the location of your CSV file.
4. Run the script. The script will prompt you to choose your CSV file.
