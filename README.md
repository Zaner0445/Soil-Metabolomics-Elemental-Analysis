# Soil-Metabolomics-Elemental-Analysis
This repository contains a custom R script for calculating and visualizing elemental ratios (C/N, C/P, C/S, O/C, H/C) in soil samples. The script processes CSV data, calculates ratios, and generates box plots to compare ratios across different soil types. It is designed for soil metabolomics research and is freely available for use.
